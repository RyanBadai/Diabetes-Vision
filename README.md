# Diabetes Vision
Diabetes Vision provides a comprehensive diabetes risk analysis tool. We direct users to upload photos of the food they consume, and our site will detect the carbohydrate and sugar content and other nutritional values of the uploaded food photos. This information becomes our reference to recommend whether the food is suitable or not for the user based on the risk analysis that has been done.
